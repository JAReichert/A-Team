# Game synopsis:

Welcome to The A-Team game! This game models itself after the hit television show from the 1980's called "The A-Team". The A-Team is a group of four highly trained soldiers, surviving in the Los Angeles underground as soldiers of fortune after being convicted of a crime they did not commit. The game allows you to be one of two members of the A-Team, John "Hannibal" Smith or B.A. Baracus. Your goal is to help the Penhall family get their last crop to the L.A. Farmer's Market. If you fail, they will lose their farm to the evil rancher Chuck Easterland. You accomplish this by fighting, retreating, and tricking Chuck Easterland and his band of goons. The game uses Python classes, while loops, functions, and if/elif/else statements. I also imported the time, random and PIL.Image libraries to increase the functionality of my program.
